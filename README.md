Webapp for Structural Tension Charting (coined by Robert Fritz)

Structual Tension charts can be used to manage any aspect of your personal or professional life. An entry consists of a specific, idealized state (e.g "I complete my undergrad with a GPA over 3.7), an objective present state (e.g "I have 2 semesters remaining, with a GPA of 3.65"), and a series of steps bridging the two states.

These steps may also be expanded into their own full entries, resulting in a nested structure with a top-level entry representing the main projects in your life. You can be as detailed as you want about any projects you wish to include in your Structual Tension map.

This project is currently pre-alpha, and is built using Racket, JQuery, SQLite, and Pure.css. The main functions being worked on now include:

* Drag-and-drop reordering of entries
* Adding user sessions, registration, login, etc
* Polishing the frontend
* Conversion from JSON data transfer
